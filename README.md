logic:

int n =121,pal,r,rev =0;
while(n>0){
as 121 is greater than 0 then enter into the loop 
r = n%10;
121%10 ==== 1 
rev = rev*10+r
0 = 0*10+1
.n = 12/1- = 12 


step 2 :

12>0 
enter into the loop
12%10 === 2 
rev == 1*10+ 2 
rev == 12 12/10  = 1;

step 3:

1>0
enter into the loop 
1%10  === 1 
12*10+1 === 121 
rev === pal 
so palindrome
