in this program we can add the odd numbers by using for loop and if condition 
logic :
for (i =1;i<=100;i++){
by using this for loop the value of i is increased up to 100 
if (i%2!=0){
the increased i value is divided by 2 if the remainder is not equal to 0 then enter into the loop 
sum = 0;
in this code the initial value of the sum is 0;
sum = sum +i;
if the i value is odd and enter in to the loop then the value will be automatically add into the sum value 
0 =0+1;
sum = 1;
1 = 1+3;
sum = 4;
this will continue up to 100 odd numbers.
