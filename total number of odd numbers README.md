count = 0;
the initial  for the count is 0;
for (i =1 ;i<=100;i++){
the value of i value will be increased up to 100 
if(i%2!=0){
the value of i will be divided by 2 if the remainder is not equal to 0 then it will enter into the condition 
count++
if the i value is odd then the count will be increased
