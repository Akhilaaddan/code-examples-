public class sum of num {
here class name is sum of num 
int sum =0;
the initial value given for the sum value is 0;
int n =10;
here the value of n given in this code is 10;
for(int i =1; i<=n;i++){
the value of i will be increased up to n value 
sum = sum +i;
the increased i value will be added to the sum value
logic:
sum = 0;
sum =sum+i;
0=0+1;
sum =1;
1 =1+2;
sum =3;
this will continue up to the n value
