logic:


code execution starts from:

public static void main(string args[]){
int n =28;
 the initial value given to n is 28;
 if (n<=0){
 print enter number greater than 0;
 else
 use logic 
 you need to go the above code witten on the main methopd 'we used void methos and the main method is static method 
 so we need to call the method 
 if (n>19){
 print(ten[n/10]+""+(one[n];
 else {
 print(one[n];
 if(n>0){
 print(ch)
 ch is empty 
 so no need to print
